/**
 * Example User Dashboard Route (Protected)
 * 
 * This is a demonstration implementation of a protected dashboard route.
 * Authentication is enforced by middleware.
 * 
 * In a real-world application, you should:
 * - Add proper SEO metadata for the dashboard
 * - Implement role-based access control if needed
 * - Add loading states and error boundaries
 * - Fetch and display user-specific data
 * - Add analytics tracking
 * 
 * Modify or replace this route based on your project's specific requirements.
